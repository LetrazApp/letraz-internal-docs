## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Name

**Letraz** â€” Craft unique resumes for each job application effortlessly

This name comes from the Spanish word "letras" that means letters or sometimes documents or resumes. We have modified the original word to suit the overall theme of our product.

### 1.2 Project Description

Unlike traditional resume builders, Letraz focuses on solving users' problems automatically, ensuring each resume is optimized based on job descriptions to increase selection chances.

### 1.3 Problem Statement

Job seekers often struggle to create impactful resumes that align with job requirements. Traditional resume builders provide static templates that do not adapt to different job descriptions. Letraz solves this problem by:

- Extracting key insights from job descriptions.
- Dynamically restructuring resume content for the best match.
- Optimizing resume presentation to improve selection chances.

### 1.4 Goals and Objectives

- Enable users to create, customize, and manage multiple resumes seamlessly.
- Automatically tailor resumes based on job descriptions using AI.
- Provide a real-time, interactive preview of the resume.
- Allow users to download resumes in professional formats (PDF, LaTeX etc..).
- Ensure a smooth user experience with a modern, intuitive UI.
- Support multiple resume templates for different industries and job roles.
