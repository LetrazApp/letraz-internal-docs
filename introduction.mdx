## Introduction

This is the go-to guide for the Letraz core team to refer to in case of any confusion. This documentation is a work in progress and will be updated regularly as we develop new processes, APIs and workflows. The documentation is divided into multiple sections, each focusing on a different aspect of Letraz. The documentation is open to the public to go in alignment with our motto of transparency.

Refer to these docs whenever in doubt about how to proceed with a task or if you want to know more about the architecture of Letraz. Whenever a new architecture or process is developed, that is added in this documentation itself. If you have any suggestions or want to contribute to the documentation, feel free to open an issue [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LetrazApp/letraz-internal-docs). If you are part of the core team then just ping the team in the Discord server.
