### Core guidelines

- Always start with an issue. Create the issue in the Linear if an issue regarding the feature/bug doesn't exist. While creating an issue, use the standard issue format that consists of a brief description of what needs to be done, bullet-point representation of the success criteria and bullet-point representation of the acceptance criteria.
- Mark the issue as in-progress when starting to work on the said issue, keep any discussions to that issue in the threads section under that issue itself.
- Use a consistent file and folder naming convention. Read through the established structure the project follows, try to repurpose the old code as there .
- Maintain a well documented code and explain with comments where necessary. Although don't over-comment stuff. Try to write code in such a way that mostly commenting isn't required.
- Try to avoid technical debt as much as possible. Document technical debt (if any) clearly in the threads section beneath the issue and prioritize on reducing it systematically.
- Use bun as the package manager for the project. Do not use npm, pnpm or yarn. Avoid unnecessary dependencies and regularly purge dependencies that are no longer being used.
- Please notify the team before introducing a new dependency (ShadCN components doesn't count, add them anytime).
- No typescript errors should be present in the code for any PR. Also don't ts-ignore any TS errors until absolutely necessary. Avoid using any type as much as possible.
- Double check lint errors and warnings before committing. No errors and ideally no warnings should be there in the committed code. Run bun run lint:fix as necessary.
- Do not directly commit into the main branch. Always commit into the corresponding branch of the Linear issue.
- Make atomic commits with clear and concise commit messages precisely communicating the changes that were made in the said commit.
- While opening a pull request, follow the PR description format. Include the link to the Linear issue, provide a description, bullet-point representation of the changes made in the PR and a closing note. Ask for review from at least two team members when opening the PR.
